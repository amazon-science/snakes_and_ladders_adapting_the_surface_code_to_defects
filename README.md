## Snakes and Ladders: Adapting the surface code to defects

This package provides tools to adapt surface code patches to the presence of non-operational qubits and gates. Based on a list of defective components, the code will define stabilizers, build stim circuits, and simulate them to get logical error rates. We used these tools to generate the code patches for the manuscript ``Snakes and Ladders: Adapting the surface code to defects''.

Examples on how to use this software can be found in the notebook `examples/snakes_n_ladders.ipynb`.

READMEs can be found in the different submodules of this package. For more details you can e-mail *Catherine Leroux* [catilero@amazon.com].
